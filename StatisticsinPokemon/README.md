# Statistics and Data in Pokémon

This is a repository of different datasets related to Pokémon. This archival website will include a variety of different sources, news articles, and projects related to the popular franchise. The content hosts data that may not be owned by me.

The website was developed during participation in summer 2020 coursework under the Digital Humanities project at the University of California, Berkeley.

The homepage or landing page will include a variety of different datasets and resources that will lead users to different sites that host a particular dataset.

There will be three subpages called, "Data Analysis Projects on Pokémon", "History of Pokémon", and "Social Impact of Pokémon".

Data Analysis Projects on Pokémon will include some separate projects of mine that I have used with the datasets from the homepage. This will also be an exhibit of other people's projects found on different websites. These will include external links that lead users to other sites of different projects.

History of Pokémon will be a timeline of all of the games released by the company.

The Social Impact of Pokémon will be an exhibit of recent news articles relating to the company's actions and participation in its part of its social responsibility.

Overall, this site will provide an exhibit of how users can create data visualizations. Since Pokémon has grown rapidly over the past decades, this provides users with a hub of information that can be gathered and used for their own personal projects.
