          <p class="tab">This website will be dedicated an archive of The Pokémon Company and data
            analysis projects. Pokémon is well known and loved by many people around the
            world. Since its humble beginnings in 1999, the franchise has grown
            tremendously. With millions of players around the world, this also makes the
            world of Pokémon a great way to start statistics-related projects. The Data
            Analysis section will include some separate projects of mine that I have
            used with the datasets. This will also be an exhibit of other people's
            projects found on different websites. These will include external links
            that lead users to other sites of different projects.The History section
            will be a timeline of all of the games released by the company. The
            Social Impact/Current Events section will be an exhibit of recent news
            articles relating to the company's actions and participation in its
            part of its social responsibility.</p>

          <p class="tab">Overall, this site will provide an exhibit of how users
            can create data visualizations. Since Pokémon has grown rapidly
            over the past decades, this provides users with a hub of
            information that can be gathered and used for their own personal
            projects.</p>
