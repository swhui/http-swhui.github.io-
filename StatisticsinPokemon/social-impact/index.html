  <h1><br>Current Events and Social Impact in Pokemon</h1>
  <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here is a collection of the latest information and
    articles from the past 2 months. I regularly update them to include the most
    recent, relevant articles. This section is meant to give users a good idea
    about recent news in the Pokémon Company. Especially as games and reviews are
    constantly being updated, it's a good idea to separate between current
    developments in the company and people's opinions/reviews.
    If there are any suggestions that you wish
    to make, feel free to
    contact me <a href="https://swhui.github.io/StatisticsinPokemon/contact/">here</a>!</p>
